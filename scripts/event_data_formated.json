After long periods of playing the pressure from the flute on my left index finger starts causing pain and numbness, which can also cause the flute to slip a little. I asked a professional flute player recently how she deals with it and she told me she builds up a callous, which will never happen for me. If I'm being snarky, I'd call it a flute design flaw. Anyway, this finger saddle has mostly cured the problem and I'm very happy. Does it scratch the flute? I haven't noticed, but if you're the person who cares that much about how your instrument looks I'd suggest keeping it in the case at all times.", "reviewerID": "A2SRUN49ERLGV0", "reviewerName": "M.

{"asin": "B0002F5IOQ", "overall": "3.0", "reviewText": "I bought this guitar used with old strings on it - even when I was checking it out it sounded good with the old steel strings.  I was able to listen to it acoustically and amplified through a clean channel, and was quite impressed with the sound for this price range guitar.  I can remember playing the original Kaman Ovations in the 1970s when the local music stores started carrying them and always wanted one, so I took the plunge and took the pretty little HoneyBurst model home.  Contrary to what the manufacturer will tell you, this guitar has a piezo pickup and will play just fine with nylon strings, and after 40 years of playing various styles, string sets, and many, many different guitars, I have become quite attached to the La Bella Folk Singer strings for smaller acoustic guitars.  Installing a new set on the Applause AE28 accomplished three things for me:\n\n1)  The slightly thicker strings lowered the action just a hair, but enough to provide very pleasant playability.\n2)  The bass response became far more noticeable and really balanced the overall sound nicely.\n3)  The cutaway portion of the neck actually became quite a bit more useable for soft jazz leads.\n\nAs to other technical considerations, the tuning gears are adequate and the guitar tends to stay in tune well with either set of strings, there are no fret buzzes, and no intonation issues.  The neck is buttery smooth and playing lead is simple at any fret, even with the thicker nylon strings.  By the way, the bridge is a string-through type and so ball end or tied on strings work equally well (and I learned long ago to tie the LaBellas on, the plastic balls on the treble strings don't hold up).  The finish is gorgeous and deeply shined, the Mother of Pearl rosette is bold but not overdone, the metal hardware shows no signs of tarnish, and the strap buttons are placed well and solid.  The preamp is a bit passive, and has pretty much an \"all or nothing\" treble control (present with both sets of strings).  I keep it way down and adjust for the sound I want at the amp/effects box.  The narrow neck, while fast and easy for general purpose lead and chording, does require some care with finger placement for more difficult styles as string interference can be an issue, this can be aggravated by playing strapless, as the rounded back tends to tilt the guitar upwards, lowering one's finger angle relative to the strings.  Simple solution for you Arlo types, wear a close fitting strap and play more carefully.\n\nLastly, consider the price point; the Applause line of guitars can be had new for as little as a buck fifty, and with four decades plus of buying and playing experience I can state emphatically that you will not find a better sounding, more reliable acoustic electric guitar in the sub-250 price range.  Perhaps this comes across as merely my opinion, but allowing for my nearly half a century of data collection, the opinion is at least empirically sound.  The \"3\" rating reflects the price point as well, this is a hugely inexpensive guitar and does not include features or build quality found on higher end models; but you can purchase this little guitar with confidence, although I would suggest (as with any guitar) that you play one somewhere first before buying one to make sure it suits you.", "reviewerID": "A1ZCNDGAOAP4N6", "reviewerName": "ccteach", "summary": "Great for the money", "verified": "false", "vote": "10", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140006267}

Because of the squashed duck sound, you may need to add a layer of pipe insulation, or other sound supression in the case of a hypersensative housemate.\n\nOverall:  It's not much fun just buzzing, but it's a good way to preserve your embrochure and air column for when you can't practice with an full horn.  This will work with small shank trombone (i.e. Bach 36).  Large shank trombones like the Bach 42, Conn 88, etc will need the large shank/bass trombone model.", "reviewerID": "A1SWFYMQ5Z679D", "reviewerName": "Clang", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" Small/Medium\"}", "summary": "A good way to preserve embrochure and air column for when you can't practice with an open horn, but annoying sound.", "verified": "false", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140006655}

{"asin": "B0002F569S", "overall": "4.0", "reviewText": "Lots to like here. Not everyone needs one of these, but it can be very useful if you have some specialized sounds that you need to get to in one stomp, but that require multiple pedals. For instance, I have one loop that contains an Electro-Harmonix B9 organ machine and a Hammond Leslie pedal -- these two together can get a great Hammond B3 + Leslie speaker sound, and with the looper -- it's on one stomp.\nI generally do not combine that with any other effects so it's great to have it one switch, then put other effects in the other loop on the other switch.\n\nI also like having the boost on the pedal. I set this one for a small boost, and I also have another clean boost pedal at the end of my chain, following this pedal. With the two I have 3 levels of clean boost -- \"moderate\", \"pretty loud\", and \"you just blew the paint off the walls\" (both combined).\n\nI've used the remote control feature as well. It's ok but what I'd really like better would have been if it had a way to switch in one stomp between the two loops. The plus side of that tradeoff is you can engage either loop or both loops simultaneously because each loop has an \"on/off\" switch. And then you have the boost.\n\nPROs\n- size is reasonable\n- seems transparent enough\n- tuner input\n- boost button with adjustable gain boost\n-two loops, plus passthrough\n\nCONs\n-Weird 15V power supply means I HAVE to use the provided wall wart. That sucks -- just make it 18V so it can run off a pedalboard \"brick\" type multiple output power supply. -1 star for this bad design choice - but more on this below.\n- The loops, when remote controlled, don't work quite the way I'd like them to in terms of how you go from one loop to another and the configurable options for the TRS input. Hard to explain here.\n\nSUMMARY\n- If you need to simplify the pedal board river dance and have a couple multi-effect sounds, this is a pretty good way to do that without a huge investment in more sophisticated controllers. The slingshot remote control option also opens up some interesting possibilities in terms of putting this in a rack with a drawer full of pedals and then putting the remote pedal in front of you. It's a cool pedal. Maybe priced a bit high for what it is. I bought mine used and still thought it was a little more than it should cost, so new the price is high. Maybe that's why there are so few reviews. Build quality seems very good. I'm happy with it but really wish they had used a 9V or 18V power supply instead of the really weird 15V option. There are other options out there with 9V and passive(no power required) options for loops. But this is still a good choice for a loop switcher pedal.\n\nON THE POWER SUPPLY\nThe Radial Engineering website, on the Tonebone Headbone VT FAQ page has these comments about the 15V power supply:\n--> Can I use the 16V or 18V output from my power brick?\nYou can, just note that this may shorten the lifespan of the internal voltage regulators. If you choose to do so, make sure you supply the Headbone with the correct polarity and sufficient current to do the job.\n\n-->Are there any manufacturers that make multi-power supply bricks that have 15V outlets?\nYes; The Cioks DC10 and AC10 both have 15V outlets for Tonebone pedals.\n\nThat would have been nice to know a couple years ago...too bad it wasn't listed for the loopbone FAQ which I did look at.", "reviewerID": "A20JJ8634DG3FS", "reviewerName": "Johnny Guitar", "summary": "Eiminate the pedalboard riverdance", "verified": "false", "vote": "2", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140006725}

The idea of a feeder that sticks to the kitchen window is great, but the implementation keeps if from working. The problem is this: Unless it is full to the brim, the nectar is too deep in the feeder for our hummingbirds to reach in and get. The red lid, and then the flower relief means the hummingbirds have to reach about 1/2 and inch to just touch the nectar when it is completely full. Once they drink even a small portion out of the nectar reservoir, they can no longer reach far enough in. So we have to keep topping it off. And keep topping it off. And then we have to top it off. All in all, would not buy again.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSELLER JUST OFFERED ME 16.00 TO REMOVE MY NEGATIVE REVIEW! ! ! !\n\nI had wondered why so few reviews mentioned this design problem. Now I know why.

In fact the name 'session' pretty much sums it up - it is perfect for studio work, and if you are playing small venues and you absolutely have to bring a crash, this is the one to use.\n\nThe fundamental is in the lower pitch range. What makes this great for the uses I described is that it opens up immediately and has a fairly short sustain. Not staccato short, but the decay is fast enough to punctuate instead of wash your music in a lingering crash.  In that respect this is also perfect for some big band use in which you want to set up the next phrase, but not step all over the melody instruments when they segue into it.\n\nThese days I rarely use crash cymbals, preferring crash/rides instead. Even though this is a 16\" cymbal it rides beautifully. It's a little on the dry side for ridding, mainly due to the smaller bell, but that makes it ideal for coloring behind a soloist. And because it does have a low fundamental, it works well as a very quiet ride behind vocalists in the tenor-to-baritone range.\n\nFrankly, among the many cymbals that I have owned over the years (and the number is in the hundreds) this is one of the best crashes I have come across.

I have been flying this flag outside my San Antonio home for several years.  The first one faded to a sky blue color and was tearing due to the thin fabric and time on the pole.  It looked like a battle flag, so I framed it!  I'm enjoying having a new, bold blue flag with the star out in front of the house again.\n\nThe last one held up for about a year of almost constant use.  For the price, you really can't beat it.  Its very affordable to replace after months or a year of use and certainly looks fantastic when in new condition.  Grommets all held up well, but did start to show some rust.

{"asin": "B0002F59K4", "overall": "4.0", "reviewText": "I'm going to write this review as a full time record producer who has owned this desk for nearly 4 years. Firstly, this desk is awesome. Right off the bat, it's a great deal. Desks like it go for upwards of $800. I only have a few critiques that I have noticed over my years of using it rigorously:\n1. The monitors sit too high. Not terribly too high as to make it super noticeable, but after a 10 hour session, you may start to feel fatigue or strain in your neck. I would say you could simply raise your chair up, but the slide-out keyboard tray will pretty much force you to stay where you are- unless you remove it.\n2. The 4 metal \"grating\" pieces on the sides are incredibly flimsy and resonate noticeably if there is too much vibration on the desk from sound.\n\nA couple of other things that are not very practical for this desk but may very well be good for someone else:\n1. The fact that there are CD holders is kind of silly to me. If not outdated, it doesn't really look good for someone with a full time audio profession to just have CDs put in their studio desk.\n2. The extra slide-out tray in the upper tier is cool for extra guitar pedals and DI boxes, but I think most would agree that it would be better if they had just put a second rack area there.\n\nWhat I ended up doing to make this desk work great for me:\n1. Took off the side \"grating\". It doesn't resonate now , routing cables and snakes is WAY easier, and it looks sleeker.\n2. Completely removed the top tier. Yes... Completely removed the top rack and sliding tray area designated for your screens. Now I don't have neck fatigue, and I also now have room for 2 pairs of studio monitors on the desk (still enough room for my dual screens as well).  I just consolidated all of my rack equipment to the bottom sides, which looks and works much better because I am not usually needing to make constant adjustments during tracking after everything is set up. Another added bonus for me: since my live room A is right behind my desk, removing the top tier made it way easier for me to see into the live room through the glass.\n\nOne thing I may do in the future is replace the wheels with bigger, higher quality wheels to make moving the desk a little easier. But besides that, I don't really see any reason to complain about them because unless you are constantly moving the desk, you probably won't ever notice them.", "reviewerID": "A1ENGWNZDGHV08", "reviewerName": "Jimbi", "style": "{\"Color:\":\" Maple\"}", "summary": "Awesome desk.

{"asin": "B0002F59K4", "overall": "5.0", "reviewText": "The product arrived on a pallet. I had hand trucks at home already to move them with. The boxes were not as heavy and hard to maneuver as I would have thought, it actually went pretty easily. I pulled it into my garage, unboxed it and carried the pieces up to my studio.\n\nAssembly of this product was very easy. It mostly uses a provided hex wrench and hex screws. I drastically cut down on the time with a very low torque drill with hex bit. The wood is particle board, the powdery grain type, so over tightening is a problem, be sure not to. Be careful with the vertical pieces under the riser, as the screws will pilot themselves new holes without much difficulty at all, making you think they are where they need to be when they are not. Also do not overtighten these, as they can bulge the wood out and throw off your upper rack alignment. The bottom rack section should be assembled but not completely torqued down until it is fully assembled. The reason I say this is that the metal pieces have to flex a little to fit the pilot holes to the screws. Once they are in place, you can tighten them down pretty well. Like others, I left off the silly CD racks (who uses CDs anymore anyway?) and used the space instead to house a 12 channel mixer (Mackie ProFX12 on a tilt platform fits perfectly in the space) and some equipment on the other side.\n\nThe dimensions translate a little differently in terms of the footprint of this desk. There is a noticeable curve to the front of the desk where it comes out further in the middle but less so on the ends. This makes it feel like the footprint is smaller. This was actually a good thing because when I measured the footprint of the desk, I was concerned about how it would fit in the space, but when it arrived, it fits really nicely, and better than I measured (even though I followed the spec).\n\nThe surface area is great, although I do wish it were somehow adjustable to a slant, but I've reverted to constructing a stand for most equipment to accomplish this instead. Without the slant, I felt like I was having to stand up with devices and look down on it to adjust (and I'm a tall person, I can only imagine this would be more evident in a shorter person).\n\nThe riser is just a little too high, like others have mentioned - you find yourself straining your neck slightly to look up at the displays/monitors, etc. To make up for it, I used monitors that could lower all the way down (Dells are fantastic in this regard when they have a vertical adjustment option, as they can adjust nearly to the surface of the desk, which is perfect for this desk), then I wound up putting the monitors on zero g arms and getting rid of the stands altogether. This turned out to be the best solution for me, as they are now fully adjustable and opened up all the surface area on the riser for other things. The studio monitors I have on a slight plane to point down (sound image blah blah) and it works great.\n\nRack alignment is dead on for me, no complaints. I have power amps, conditioners, breakouts, effects racks, and several other pieces of equipment scattered around. I would not expect to be able to rack 100 lb. devices in this thing, it wouldn't be practical or sensible, but for the most equipment, it is great. One thing that I did not know that I wish I had caught was that the desk does come with screws for the rack. I ordered a few packages of the Raxxess PTSW25 rack screws with it, but wound up not using them.\n\nThe casters on this desk are fantastic. They are very strong, and can support a lot of weight.\n\nThe cable management options built into the desk are pretty good as well, there are cable trays on the back, pre-cut holes in the compartments on the top,\n\nThings I wish this desk had : Built-in Lighting - Solid wood construction surface - better finish (darker would be nice).

{"asin": "B0002F59K4", "overall": "2.0", "reviewText": "This desk was bought for me by family that was attempting to help solve my ergonomics problems and space issues with my existing furniture. i wish i had spent more time at the store where i saw this thing before declaring it was what i wanted. My fault.\n\n The thing is, the idea of it is pretty good. Having built-in rack space is great. Having the pull-out drawer for desktop synths (my Virus TI fit perfectly on that drawer). However:\n\n- The upper rack/shelf piece of this desk is too high for comfort with computer displays and too short of width to accommodate good stereo separation with studio monitors.\n\n- The available desk surface area is poor. Very little depth available to place anything on the desk.\n\n- The rack screws this thing came with are rather soft metal and apparently somewhat nonstandard in thread. i can barely use them on my other racks, so the nice fact of a bag of these being included becomes insult when you find they don't work without massive effort. i've chewed up the heads of several screws putting them in and removing them. They're basically disposable.\n\n- The wheels make the desk too high. This is already a problem because the place where you're expected to put a computer display is too high. Even with a chair raised up to maximum height, the desk is too high. It's about exactly the wheel's height too high. Removing them, or not using them to begin with, sounds good until you realize this desk is difficult to move without them.\n\n- The keyboard tray frame/arms extend too low (where are we supposed to put our legs??). The keyboard tray issue is common. i've never installed a single keyboard tray on any desk that's come with one.\n\n- The plastic strip around the edge of the main desk surface was pre-assembled incorrectly. It's upside down. The sharp cut edge is oriented upward and the smoothed curved edge is oriented downward. Totally backwards. This makes a very sharp edge in contact with my arms as i work at the desk.\n\n- The left and right rack areas are a nice idea completely defeated by the flimsy metal side pieces. Since the back metal piece is used to provide stability to the parts that make up the \"legs\", there's no way to get to the wiring of your devices. You certainly cannot get to them from the sides. You're left with having to crawl underneath the rack devices to deal with connections. Bring a flash light down there with you.\n\n- The CD holder pieces on the far ends under the monitor surface are structurally necessary. If you think that leaving them out of the assembly is a good idea for desktop surface area, you're right, but you'll also encounter risk of damaging the desk if you attempt to move it much (say, from room to room or house to house, etc). If you tilt the desk enough while transporting it, the top portion will likely fall and tear the sockets where it was supposed to be secured. The cross dowels(?) holding the very top portion down onto the rack/shelf are totally useless for securing anything because they do not tighten whatsoever. They are always loose in their sockets. This makes the CD holders structurally necessary. But this is just bad design.\n\n- Somewhat top-heavy. Especially if you have the wheels on, a CRT and monitors on the top, and rack gear in the upper rack. Be careful when moving it.\n\n In the end, i actually removed the entire top rack/shelf piece of the desk so i could put slanted table-top racks on the main flat surface, at the far ends, pointing inward. This has actually been an excellent solution and is a design concept seen in more professional workstations made for studios, but this defeats the prime reason for having bought this desk to begin with. My end solution was to abandon a large part of what makes this workstation what it claims to be. Since this thing has no drawers (and rack drawers are not cheap), I'd have been better off with a large generic desk from Ikea or something similar, rather than this so-called \"studio workstation.\"\n\ni don't recommend this desk if you are not tall, have a short chair, or nearsighted and prefer not to use near-range glasses (long distance glasses for up-close work tend to cause eye strain). i also do not recommend it if you still have a CRT, or if you need desktop surface area. Forget using the M-Audio ProjectMix I/O, as it will not fit here.\n\n Don't be fooled by the design concept, which is a nice idea. The ergonomics are poor, the assembly is poor (even if you are able to assemble it successfully, you may find that the basic parts are themselves wrong).\n\nOther than that, it's fine. :-P", "reviewerID": "AKXQFBCVB3FR7", "reviewerName": "J.

My other meat probe worked fine, but I had to be at the meat (oven-grill) to stab the meat to check the temperature. Each stab of the probe of course letting out my previous tasty juice.\nThis is a unit which you install the probe into the meat/fish/etc. and run the cable out of your oven  grill to a base in which it plugs into. You then set the main meter unit to your desired food type and how you want it cooked. The remote receiver will show you how high the temperature needs to get for your food to reach the desired temperature and also displays the current temperature. (You can select from C or F.)\n\nI love this type of design as I do not need to poke the food several times and just once to insert the probe leaving my food as juicy as possible. This also lets me check the progress INSIDE the house and up to 100 from the base vs. running outside or to the kitchen from where I am. The display is nice and big and you can read this without squinting or needing to pick this up.\n\nAnother nice thing I like is how the transmitter which the probe attaches to doubles as a base in the event you do not need to take the receiver anywhere.  It holds it up and allows you view temps easily at a glance.\n\nFew Quick Specs and Technical Facts\n-This requires four AAA batteries. Two go into the receiver and two into the transmitter. (Not included.)\n-You can select from 8 built in meats and four different tastes or cook levels.\nPork, Turkey, Chicken, Fish, Beef, Lamb, Veal and Hamburger.\nRare, Medium Rare, Medium and Well Done.\n-Temperature goes from 32-392 degrees F or 0-200 degrees C.\n-Range goes up to 100. Less if not clear line of sight or if signal has to travel through walls.\n\nSummary  This works very well and the features make this my favorite food thermometer. I would certainly recommend this to friends-family and would be a great gift for BBQ fans.\n\nI don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.\n\nPlease note I have no relationship with this seller and Im not compensated in any way for my review.

{"asin": "B0002F5FXA", "overall": "4.0", "reviewText": "I went with this over buying a skb or other brand hard/molded case. I usually always go for molded cases, but I was going to be doing international traveling with my v-kit. The molded cases out there where either too large/small too heavy, etc. to get on airplanes without having to pay hundreds of dollars extra for every flight.\n\nSo I rolled the dice on this case and this is what I found:\n\n+ It's much larger than I expected, I read the measurements and measured things but for some reason it was a lot taller than I  had thought. I'm 5'11'' and with the handle extended the case is about shoulder height.\n\n+ Had to repack a few times to get the weight distribution right, there's metal braces on the back of the case and it can hold a lot of weight, but moving around with it can be tricky, and it will not stand up on it's own (i.e. fall over and crush your stuff) if it's even slightly top heavy (due to it's length)\n\n+ Some of the seams and nylon began to rip/come apart immediately, but nothing major that would compromise the case. This was probably due to stuffing it a little full and having a lot of strain around the seams of the case.\n\n+ There are no internal straps, there is a strange zipper at the bottom that exposes the spine/metal supports at the back, but nothing to physically secure taller/heavier things. So if the case is prone to shifting and falling over if stored upright, as well gear movement when it's in transit. I ended up getting a couple straps and riveting them to the back plate/support area which made for less tipping and secure items during transit.\n\n+ The airlines tried their hardest to destroy the contents, but for a soft case I was amazed at the abuse it was able to protect my kit from. For example the first stop I had requested the case packed on top (paid for it actually) and the lady put about 30 fragile stickers on the case. When I landed and got the case, almost all the fragile stickers where gone, there were footprints all over the top of the bag, and it looks like it was thrown/fell hard enough to bend the back supports and break off one of the bottom support legs.\n\nI had no way of testing anything until setting up to play before the show, but I was amazed that not only was there not a nick on a single item, everything worked perfectly. After that, I relaxed and that case got kicked, dropped smashed, carried on top of a bus in the rain for several hours, and all number of stress inducing situations....happy to say through all that everything is in tact and working.\n\n+ The case took so much abuse over the month and a half of traveling it is ripped, bent, missing a large strip of nylon etc. BUT\nNot a single zipper broke or broke a seam, not a single critical component (wheels, handle, zippers, padding, etc.) was damaged beyond functioning or completely broken. It may not look very good anymore but it took the abuse of several airlines, touring in central america taking all the rain, heat, and elements thrown at it, and returned it's contents safely home.\n\n+ If you're looking for a cost and travel effective case that will suite that and only that purpose; this is a great case.\n\nIn a more practical situation I  don't think anything beats the old rolling road case as far as long term use, non-airline portability, and protection. This case would probably get rather annoying to use for a drummer playing locally/on the road in their home country because it requires total breakdown of your kit/hw, and it doesn't offer the durability, ease of use or protection of a hard case. But for a ad hoc solution to suite necessity it's worth every penny.", "reviewerID": "A1C2J0GHQATZ77", "reviewerName": "./bin/do-review", "summary": "but for a soft case I was amazed at the abuse it was able to protect my ...", "verified": "true", "vote": "5", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007207}

I was so excited to get this bass til I got it out from the box, I don't know if it was my mistake but I got a very SIMILAR version of the bass shown in the pictures, I mean I know the LTD series are kind of different cuz they are manufactured in china in a line production instead of being handcrafted, but the finish, the curves(you know all the gothic style stuff) and the headstock are completly different from the shown ones in the picture, I mean the edges are almost \"unseen\", the headstock is very similar but it looks soooooo crapy in comparizon with the one in the picture. Ok those were the cons Ive found so far, once I dryed the tear of sadness that came out from my eye once I saw it, I connected it to my amp(by the way at least it IS active but the battery cap is screwed and I cant remove the battery once Im done playing unless I carry my screwdriver, half star less T.T).I played some notes and I found it wasn't calibrated( intonation good abut too little action), other 30 mins adjusting the rod. Pluged back in and then I decided to go metal, put Broken,Beat and Scared of Metallica and played all along without stoping, I got amazed of the really good damn sound this bass provides to the metal music, after the desapointing surprise of the beginning I played this bass for about 3 hours and it responded great, cant comply of all after all, not really good looking(at least not as spected cuz it looks nice) but high performance for a $300 bass", "reviewerID": "A10XFQ2IXCOZCH", "reviewerName": "Icaro", "style": "{\"Color:\":\" Black\"}", "summary": "Hard to swallow", "verified": "true", "vote": "8", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007285}

After assembly, the top right support bar, that goes over the leg with the clutch trigger in it, will not come off.  The top of the clutch rod seems to lock into the support arm some how, and nothing I do can get this thing off to disassemble the stand for return or any other reason.  I see now that others have had this same problem as described in other reviews, which I didn't notice before.\n\n2.  The clutch trigger angles up (toward the support arm) instead of down (away from it).  This means that there is no room to actually pull the clutch trigger to change the stand position, unless you first unscrew and remove the clutch trigger handle (a plastic and rubberish sleeve that screws over the metal post that is the clutch trigger), and also remove the rubber end cap from the support arm, which may require removing, or at least moving, your keyboard.  So, all convenience is lost for this stand.  Whoever came up with this design should be fired and blacklisted from all engineering industries.\nAgain, I see people talk about this in other reviews, but didn't notice before I purchased.\n\nI thought Onstage was a good company until I bought this stand, and see how badly designed it is.

Only draw back of those is they come in 6', 8' or 10' 'sticks' which potentially mean lots of joints.  2) Best installed on a very hot day.  3) use a heat gun to heat it up to form a right angle, etc.  4) you can get large galvanized nails from a home center which are cheaper than the plastic nails.  Or, you can even use landscape fabric staples, although it may be better to use corrosion resistant ones.  I recommend using a fastener at least about every 8 or 10\".", "reviewerID": "A2GOWH5UKQQY0N", "reviewerName": "M.

Ideally we formed the edge to stand on its own but there are times when you need to add support or prevent weeds or plants invading areas right next to each other and that's where these borders are used.\n\nThis is not decorative and while the description says there is no need to bury it I disagree. These are unsightly above ground and need to be slightly buried to hide it.\n\nIf used next to the lawn these are used to prevent the grass from getting into flower bed and to help stop weeds from the flower bed getting into the lawn. These should be at or slightly below the root level of the grass. This will prevent the roots from getting into the garden bed and you can still mow or trim up to the edge. If the dirt in your garden bed is slightly below the top of this border you will have the perfect height. You won't see the border but the grass will make the visual border.\n\nWhen using these to separate a rock garden next to the lawn you can put it just below the grass level. This will hide the border but still give you enough of an edge to lay the rock or gravel. In this case you wouldn't want to mow too close to the rocks.\n\nA twenty foot section comes with 8 stakes. If properly laid and partially buried 8 stakes should be enough to stake the border even in a circle.\n\nThe actual height of this is 1 3/4 inches. Which is plenty if you lay it correctly.\n\nOverall, this is a sturdy material to help create a border or edge in your garden.", "reviewerID": "A3T7V207KRDE2O", "reviewerName": "SMXSteve", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" 20-Feet\"}", "summary": "Great for making a sturdy border or separation", "verified": "false", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007524}

It maps out various shapes and locations, but does a poor job of keeping things like soil or mulch in a confined space. Even a little power from a blower or aggressive watering tends to leave debris outside of the edging.\n\nSecond, the 20ft roll only came with 8 stakes. For a product that emphasizes the ability to add curvy shapes, there's not really enough stakes included to achieve most of those shapes. In a straight line, you're only going to have a stake every two and a quarter feet. If you're trying to make curves, you'll probably end up with quite a few larger sections with no staking. This can also lead to soil bleed from the unconfined bed. You can buy additional stakes from Dimex or a bag of generic ones from your local home garden center, though.\n\nIf you have a delicate flower bed or very fine soil, this will probably work out for you - but if you're planning this as a guard in a mulched bed, I'd personally look for something a bit higher - or do some sort of combination edging where you can lift this edging another one to two inches.", "reviewerID": "A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2", "reviewerName": "Storm the Penguin", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" 20-Feet\"}", "summary": "A nice edger, but very short and few included stakes", "verified": "false", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007526}

{"asin": "B015T8RZTQ", "overall": "4.0", "reviewText": "I really love the idea of this edging system because I have always found one of the more torturous jobs in the garden is edging flower beds. Also, the older I get the more my knees hate the job, so any innovation is a worthwhile experiment. This material does everything that it says it will (though I have one reservation I'll get to in a minute) and it's very simple to use: you just clean out the area that you are going to edge and then lay this in place and \"nail\" it down.\n\nSo good so far, but unfortunately for me, the knees are still involved. You have to clean out the edging area and create a pleasing shape to the bed, you just don't have to dig as deeply. The material is supple enough so that truly, all you have to do is follow along on your curve and drive in a spike every few feet--and those spikes are pretty good, they have a kind of long thread and the go in nicely (use a rubber mallet). I personally would probably buy more spikes if I was going to be doing any intricate curves, but for a simple curve, the six that come with the 20' of edging are OK. One thing I saw on TV once, a good idea, is to use a supple old garden hose to lay out the curve so that you can previsualize your little bed's shape.\n\nThis brings me to me one issue here: Part of the reason that digging in traditional edging might work better is that grass and other plants (like creeping myrtle, a common perennial bed plant here in New England) migrate by root and so part of what the old style of deeper edging does is to prevent plants from migrating in or out of your beds. Yeah? I think so. So while digging that deeper plastic in might be a pain, there is a purpose to it. But who knows (I'll find out soon enough) maybe just having a border there will stop most of the creeping anyway. I'll be thrilled if that's so and I'll buy a lot more of this stuff.\n\nOne other thought. Because I prefer to just stick one side of the mower wheels into the bed when I mow rather than weed whacking, you have to dig yourself enough of a gully so that this edging material is kind of flush to where the grass will be. This is just me, however, and my endless desire to avoid weed whacking.\n\nOverall the product is nicely made, nicely thought out and really simple to use.

How can this help, I thought if it doesn't rotate?\n\n  It was then that I attached it to my machine and got to work.  I still didn't think much of the special \"shred ring\" until I caught hold of a group of leaves that had stuck together and clogged the machine.  However,  in clearing the funnel, I noticed that when the leaves were being sucked into the blade from the outside walls of the funnel because of the centrifugal force involved in the vacuum!  Around and around they go, pushing themselves against the side of the tube right into the path of the \"shred ring\" with its immovable teeth!  There was no avoiding those teeth, and with the force of suction on them and the rotation, I realized that the teeth were chewing the leaves into smaller bits even before the main propeller blade even got a chance!\n\n  I really saw why those teeth did not need to move; I thought at that time that it was so simple it was genius!  Of course, nothing is perfect, but it does do a better job on mulching the thin leaves, and this, of course, may save the longevity of the blade in time, I hope!

Do put the bait on BEFORE inserting the batteries (the instructions have batteries listed before the bait so I did that first without thinking, but to be honest see #3 ... )\n3. I thought the bait would be something you just 'drop' into .... nope, it is actually a piece of rubber tubing (similar to what you use on an aquarium pump) about 3/4 - 1 inch long. You have to push it onto a holder. It is very difficult to get on. There is a tool provided, but I did not find it very helpful at all. If you have weak hands, or arthritis, you will need someone else to assemble them. I do wish it were easier to put on. I REALLY dislike this and it is the reason I only gave 3 stars.\n4. It says nothing in the directions about touching the scented tube thingy, so I did it w bare hands. I hope that won't skeer my deer away, but hey, they are like pets here. More wild deer may not like that and so I suggest wearing latex gloves to put them on. (?)\n5. The scented tube thingy is REALLY scented (not an unpleasant smell) I would describe it mostly as pine scent, that isn't really it maybe but the closest thing I can think of to describe it. It is very strong and after handling them I have washed and washed and I cannot get rid of the smell from my hands and it is making my throat and mouth and eyes itch like crazy. So I have concluded I am allergic to whatever it is, but then I am allergic to all things scented (fabric softener, perfume, hairspray, deodorant ect) So if you are sensitive to that type of thing, do wear gloves. I wish it said this in the instructions, I could have avoided this itching!\n6. Have not installed them yet, but there does seem to be an inadequate stake so I will probably need to find a way to stake them better than what it comes with.\n\nUPDATE, been using these for months now, they do seem to deter the deer from my garden. They do not stand up independently, so I have had to attach them to a more sturdy stake, otherwise they fall over if the ground is soft- (rain) or moles get around them ect. They are easy to move around and I have found that moving them every week or two is more effective, keeps the deer from getting used to where they are. I have replaced the scented tubes a few times now and still really dislike this chore. I will  not be purchasing anymore of these in the future because of this design.

I'm telling you this thing is awesome at low volumes, reverb sounds great, add some onboard tape echo effects, select either a Marshall type tone or Fender and you can't go wrong for playing in the house.  And it can get cranking loud with good thumping as well (Alice in Chains, etc.).

But the selection of models on this amp yields a wide variety of sounds.  My biggest beef - and one that may prohibit this from being a serious recording amp - is the noise.  Even with the master volume all the way off, there is an unacceptable level of his and hum.  Turning down the power knob on the back of the amp helps this.

Restrung, we moved to a second attempt at tuning it. None of the strings would stay in tune and after several adjustments, the bridge actually seperated from the body of the guitar, rendering it unplayable. Don't be duped. This is a toy guitar. They market it towards kids because most will just be playing with it and banging on it, no concern for actual correctness And they market it towards beginners hoping that people will be looking at price, not investigating quality. If that's what you're looking for, then this is perfect. I found out the hard way: If you're serious about learing the guitar, make the inital investment for a decent one. Visit an actual store and try a few out, ask questions, shop around. I've found quite a few nice beginner guitars for a little over $100. And if you make the investment in a nicer instrument, you're more likely to recoup most of your losses if learning it doesn't work out or when you're ready to move on to a better one.

{"asin": "B0002F6KKC", "overall": "5.0", "reviewText": "Usually you see reviews that are at the honeymoon stage with an instrument.  Let me give you a review of a 12 yr. old Washburn D-100 that has been mine since new. The guitar has always performed flawlessly for a 100 dollar guitar.  Action remains good after all these yrs. and all I have ever done is a 1/8th turn on the truss rod to bring it down a tad, that's it, besides good strings and wooden bridge pins.\n\nThe guitar has turned from the original almost pine white, to a deep dark golden amber. It looks like a very expensive guitar which it is not.  I've never babied this instrument, but it has flown over 10 times between Dallas Texas where it was purchased and Honolulu Hawaii where it now lives, that's a lot of jostling that many guitars wouldn't survive.  Never an issue with the bridge, or wood in all the time I have owned it.  If you look closely in certain lights, the top has risen a bit, but it is expected on an over decade old guitar, highly played and exposed to the Hawaiian sun, and humidity.  For the price, I don't care.\n\nI play it in multiple tunings and it has never failed me in any of them. Loud, articulate and projective are all honestly used words that describe this instrument. For the money and for players that want an inexpensive guitar that they don't have to worry too much about, this is the one.  It's too bad that the orginals are no longer made and the price has gone up.  But if you have one, it will give you years of playing enjoyment for the price of good strings and maybe some better bridge pins. Cosmetic issues are pretty rare, mine has lost a couple of the little tiny tuner bushings that go between the button and shaft, but it affects nothing.

There's plenty of room in the headstock area and the body cavity is pretty decent.\nThe lining in the case itself is whatever. It's not like the GREATEST THING HOLYPOOP but it's something that will protect my pretty little guitar from the big mean world.

Do you literally ONLY have a window sill in which to grow plants? Then you've found the perfect product!\n\nI've bought two of the \"Back to the Roots\" products lately-- the Garden-In-A-Jar Basil and Garden-In-A-Jar Cilantro. The basil has just began to sprout, so I see some tasty organic basil pesto in my not-so-distant future! I haven't started the cilantro yet, but once it's growing, I'll soon be able to enjoy some homemade pico de gallo!\n\nI'd been interested in this company's products since discovering the aquaponics aquarium (which I'll end up buying for myself sooner or later), so I was excited to see these two products at my local Home Depot.\n\nI purchased both, and was excited to learn of their \"in kind\" giving program, where they donate the same product to a classroom of your choice. Several of my friends are teachers, and I know one has been trying to get her (middle school) students interested in the world around us (especially the roots of the food we eat). So win-win. I bought two awesome products with two of my favorite herbs, and my friend gets two products which will engage her students' interest in the food they eat and its origins. Kids today don't always have the ability to grow a garden with their families like I did as a child, and far too often, believe food comes from the supermarket. So products like these, which are practical, functional, user-friendly, (and delicious), are something anyone can enjoy. And anytime any company pays it forward like BTTR does, I know I've found a company I want to support.\n\nThis product also comes in can versions, as well as a four-pack with the herbs sage, dill, basil, and cilantro. When I can find the others, I know I'll be buying them. And since almost anything can be found on Amazon (believe me there, someone who's a veteran of the \"can't sleep, may as well online shop\" conundrum), or through the company's own website (...), I'll likely be reaping the benefits of my harvest of those two soon.", "reviewerID": "AMEHWQBQLS2NG", "reviewerName": "Melinda Harkema", "summary": "Window sill gardens!", "verified": "true", "vote": "7", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007956}
{"asin": "B0002F6JH6", "overall": "3.0", "reviewText": "I've been using the same Quik Lok 2-tier \"X\" stand for over 22 years to hold my 88-key keyboards (Nord Stage 2, Kurzweil PC88) with few complaints, and that stand's design makes it very easy for one person to set up and fold down at gigs/practices.  It's limited on choices of height adjustment, but its quality and simplicity are its strengths.  I wanted to buy a second stand that will remain in my home studio so that I don't have to keep dragging the X-stand up and down stairs each week when I go for gigs/practices.  This On-Stage Z stand will handle that task for me, but I have a couple of complaints.\n\nWhile this stand is very stable and good for studio use where you'll be configuring it and leaving it set up for a while, I do not recommend it for gigging or dragging to practice sessions unless you have a roadie to set it up for you (ha!).  There are too many knobs to loosen/remove, and too many pieces to carry and re-adjust each time you set it up.  It gets tiresome after just a couple times of going through the break-down & set up process.\n\nA major complaint is that the vertical height adjustment for the lower keyboard does not allow the key bed of, say, a Nord Stage 2, to be set at standard piano height.  (That's about 28.25\" from floor to top of white keys.)  This is important if you plan to sit at a standard piano bench height.  With this stand at its lowest height adjustment, my Nord key bed was about 32\" from the floor.  That's OK for playing while standing, but not great while sitting.  So I needed to modify their design by marking then drilling four additional adjustment holes (using a 1/4\" drill bit), spacing the holes one-inch apart, above the holes that were already there.  (This is on the diagonal of the \"Z\".)  I have the tools and skills needed to do this, but I can see it being a deal-breaker for those who won't bother with such modifications.\n\nMy final nit-pick is that I wish the stand had a softer edge for part of the \"Z\" the rests on the floor.  Call me a Bohemian, but at home I usually wear socks but no shoes (I know -- scandalous!).  Accidentally stepping on the edge of this stand is a real pain-in-the-foot!  If the front of the floor piece was tapered/rounded or even had a slip-on rubber-ish cover, it would be less painful.\n\nOverall, for its price, this is a sturdy, adjustable stand, but it could be greatly improved with just a couple of minor design changes.", "reviewerID": "A228ZH49HQEPA7", "reviewerName": "DavidK", "style": "{\"Color:\":\" MultiColored\"}", "summary": "Inexpensive and sturdy, but complex, too tall, and can be painful!", "verified": "true", "vote": "5", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140007957}

The sockets on the 'feet' and top supports are over-sized and fit the 'X' brace like boots on a rooster. I had to torque down the fastenings to the point where I was afraid I would strip the threads. It still doesn't feel solid.\n2. The top supports are not aligned with each other, and the keyboard rocks (literally). The rubber feet are not grippy, and the bars are bare metal, so the keyboard only rests solidly at only two points. It's like sitting at a wobbly table in a cafe, and we all know how annoying that can be. The keyboard also slides around at the slightest touch...not a confidence builder. Do you want to watch your $1500 keyboard go crashing to the stage in the middle of a glissando?\n3. The locking device on the X-braces works well and is very handy for quick height changes. However, the lowest setting still puts my keyboard nearly 3 inches higher than a standard piano keyboard. I realize many musicians prefer to stand at the keyboard, and the height seems geared to this approach. Definitely too high for sitting, and I have a non-adjustable bench.\nAll in all, I regret purchasing this stand. Because of sloppy design and workmanship, I would not recommend this stand to anyone.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome updates to this review are in order.

The stand is still too tall, but I cranked my piano stool up and it will do. FIVE STARS for the customer service...and 3 for the stand.

First of all the actual glove part is way too big. I am female and normally wear a size large glove in gardening gloves and these are absolutely huge. The finger length is barely long enough but they are just far too wide and bulky for me to feel I want to stick my hand into a hot grill and pick up hot food to turn it. I would be afraid I would not be able to feel what I was gripping because there is so much extra material around my fingers and hands. The danger of dropping something is my concern there.\n\nThe gloves really do block out the heat and allow you to touch hot food while wearing them, but in order for them to be an effective tool in cooking on the grill, they would need to be more fitted and even a little snug. I had my husband try them on and for him the fingers are too short but they are still massively wide on him.\n\nThe other major flaw of these gloves that makes me not feel safe using them is that they are not long enough up my arm. We do not even have a huge grill but if I put my hands all the way on the grill, the exposed part of my arm is going to feel the heat. If you had a big grill like some people have, this could result in severe burns because grills have a tendency to flame up. I have a small grill and would not put my hand in the grill while hot with these on. As you can see in my photos my arm would be exposed and subject to burns if my grill flamed up...and often flaming up occurs when you turn meat and it causes grease to drop into the heating source of the grill.\n\nI really wanted to like these grilling gloves but unfortunately they are just not going to work for me. While they would be ok to pick up hot pans from the oven they are marketed to use to turn food on the grill and I just do not feel I can safely do that with these gloves. I noticed in the pictures on this listing the show the person with some sort of black sleeves. If those are his clothes, imagine a flame jumping up and starting his shirt on fire. To me in order for these to be safely used in fire, they would need to come up to the elbows at least.\n\nThanks for reading my review\n\nBecky Brooks\n\n*Thank you to Beaumont Kitchenware for sending me a free pair of grilling gloves to try out.

I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I have ten years of classical piano experience and I was pleasantly surprised to find that concertina uses a similar skill set. Within a day of delivery, I was already making lovely music on my squeezebox as I learned off a book. Maybe this isn't true for everyone, but I found it ridiculously easy to pick up. It's the easiest instrument I've ever tried to learn.\n\nWhile nobody will mistake this for a \"proper\" concertina (the bellows are canvas and paper!), it is a good, working instrument with a lovely, sweet sound. The buttons are big and easy for beginner fingers to find, and everything is in working order although I did have to poke more holes into the hand straps to fit my smaller hands. It doesn't come with a box or a bag, but it did have snaps that snap it closed. This makes it portable, and being so lightweight it's definitely an instrument I'll be able to bring to camp outs or festivals without worrying about damaging an expensive instrument.\n\nThe volume is fairly quiet, but all the better to practice with without driving your loved ones crazy. Although it needs more air than more advanced concertinas, that never got in the way of my playing pretty fast.

I got this to try to figure out the hardness of our water since we are in an old house with old pipes. I have had the hardest time getting our clothes completely clean, and all the deposits on the faucets are driving me crazy. So, we went with this one and I'm glad we did!\n\nIts incredibly easy to use! No calibrating, and no worrying if you are doing it right. Its ready to go right out of the case (it comes with a really nice leather type case with a velcro top to keep it safe). Just turn it on, wait for it to say zero, then dip it into water. It recommends no more than 2\" deep, which is so easy. You can see it measuring as it works, and then it will eventually stabilize and settle on a number. If you wanted to save the number, just press the \"hold\" button and it will save it. Thats it!\n\nWe found out that our house water is coming up at just over 300 ppm in total solids, so it is moderately hard, so now I know for sure that I can start supplementing my wash routine with Borax. This was a great thing to have to find that out! I also decided to test the water that comes through our refrigerator filter and it was definitely much better! The fridge water showed up in the 140s, so a big difference!\n\nOverall, I think this is a great little meter to have if you are just looking for a reliable hardness tester and it was right in line with what the water softener salesperson said that our water was at. I'm very happy with it and glad to know the numbers. I know that this is a great item to have if you do any kind of home brewing as well, and I will say that it has been accurate for us.\n\n**I did receive this item at no charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but my cost has no bearing on how I rate a product.**", "reviewerID": "A1BF4VBEFB79BN", "reviewerName": "Telling it like it is", "summary": "Gave us the same numbers that the water softener sales person gave us, so its reliable as far as that goes!", "verified": "false", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140008156}

Both her and I have always had dry skin and other problems and lately she has been wanting to test the water's PH and solid count to see if the water filter is working properly.\n\nBoth of these devices are pretty decently made overall. They are made out of a relatively thin plastic material and are overall very light in weight...that being said they feel like they are pretty solid in terms of overall durability. Both of them are relatively easy to use with one major difference. The PH meter must first be calibrated before you use it, while the  total dissolved solid water quality meter allows you to use it right away. The PH meter specifically comes with both a small adjustment screwdriver, as well as buffer powder, which are both needed to properly calibrate the device. Neither are needed for the total dissolved solid water quality meter, as it already comes factory calibrated.\n\nAll in all I can attest that both meters at least work...as they both are able to come up with a reading.

The lower the TDS level in the water, the more efficiently your body's cells can use the water. Conversely, higher TDS levels can indicate water that is more difficult for your body to use and has more contaminants that can pose health risks.\n\nThis meter is factory calibrated with dual range measurement and a 10 minute auto-shutoff to conserve battery life.

{"asin": "B0002F5H74", "overall": "5.0", "reviewText": "I have an interesting story.\n\nSo I have a mid 80s Peavey Patriot bass.  It was gifted to me as a Christmas gift in the late 90s.  The bass, Jeremy as I like to call her, is built like a tank.  American made, and really sounds great.  At the time, in my mid teens, I was playing a lot of bass guitar and it was a great little \"Precision\" flavored axe to play on.  Over the years, I switched back to playing guitar full time, though still play bass on recordings.  Actually, it was always my favorite part of a recording session to record the bassline with a piece of my childhood.\n\nCut to more recently and this great little bass needed a bit of a makeover.  I hated to change things around on it to much, but I felt like it needed an upgrade to keep up with the direction I was going.  I also have a great friend who does a lot of my work so I knew we could really bring her into today.  The pickup that came on the Peavey is a ferrite soap bar model.  Not a bad sound by any means, though I do prefer, at least typically, an alnico magnet.  I did some research and read some great reviews about the Duncan Quarter-Pound stuff so I went all in.  I also bought a custom pickguard from pickguard.com (seriously).  They were unsure about spacing though, essentially I had them make a pickguard that'd fit a regular telecaster (guitar) route.  I also had them not cut an input jack into the pickguard as I planned on having the jack added into the wood (the only smart way).  I also found a heavy duty, all brass \"bad-ass\" style bridge on clearance for cheap to round out the upgrade.\n\nLong story short, this pickup change is a BIG change from the old ferrite soap bar - it's LOUDER, a ton of output, and BIGGER sounding.  Still, it's pretty versatile.  I have the pickup itself down pretty low to the guard to try and tame a bit of the output.  Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, you may have to have some custom \"legs\" put onto this if it's being mounted to a pickguard.  I kept all the original parts of the old bass in case I didn't like it, though I think it was the smart move to go this way.  If you're a rocker or play heavy music, you can keep the pickup closer to the strings to get a punchier sound.  If you want a flatter sound, you can pull the pickup back a bit and it sounds nice and mellow.  It still retains a nice \"old school\" tele bass sound - kind of makes me think of the Fender basses Sting plays from the mid 50s which is why I bought the pickup in the first place.\n\nThis is a good buy and for the price, you can't go wrong.", "reviewerID": "A2PJJIHZY11MC4", "reviewerName": "Jin J X", "summary": "Powerful Pickup", "verified": "true", "vote": "2", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140008245}

The slope of the brush handle gives you good leverage to really scrub the grates, but at the same time keeping your hands and knuckles away from the grill. The bristles are nice and firm and the brush head with its three rows simply covers a lot of surface area in very few strokes.\n\nAfter scrubbing my grill, I simply finish it by using a wet paper towel on the hot grate and all the gunk just comes off.\n\nGreat brush.

I have stoves, cups, clothes and even ME to clean. Packs, tents and dogs are usually covered in muck & dirt... And that's if the weather cooperated with us. In order to keep my gear & equipment serviceable, It needs to get cleaned & stowed away so that it is ready for the next mission and or emergency scenario.\n\nSometimes it takes good gear to clean & maintain good gear. Recently I was sent a Worlds Best Brass Hose Nozzle to review. With a name like that... They must be extremely confident with their product. After putting this nozzle through my review, I have to state that I tend to agree.\n\nMy wife had bought at least 4 nozzles this summer. She waters her plants, flowers, grass & also cleans our pavers each morning with a good hose-down. Now, none of these other nozzles were cheap. They also made amazing claims & had great marketing campaigns behind them. Well, here we are at the end of the summer and not one of those 4 hose nozzles remain intact. So as you can imagine, I was interested in seeing if this brass nozzle would hold up to it's claims.\n\nI thoroughly tested this brass nozzle during my review process and I am very impressed. The quality of it's construction and the thought that was put into it's design certainly leaves an impression. That fact that it has a simple design with no cheap parts gives me confidence that it will last for years. There is minimal preventative maintenance required but if you do maintain it, it will serve you well.\n\nThe Bottom Line: If you are in the market for a quality hose nozzle that will last, take a closer look at this Brass Hose Nozzle By Worlds Best. I do not think that you will be disappointed.\n\nWatch My Video Review For More Detail.\n-Hg", "reviewerID": "A32ADSPOSPCX9H", "reviewerName": "Coach Helder", "summary": "A Quality Hose Nozzle That Lives Up To It's Name.", "verified": "false", "vote": "3", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140008512}

And I do \"like\" it, which is Amazon's definition of 4 stars.\n\nFirst, the good stuff.  This metronome has an almost ideal form-factor.  I love the dial indicator, which allows for near immediate tempo setting.  I love the virtual swing bar, which I find much more useful than an audible tock when practicing.  I love how loud the audible tock is, however, for situations where you need to hear it over the din of other things.  The two slide switches (Power/swing-only/swing+audio and a beats/tuning freq) are both simple and intuitive, again allowing for almost immediate setting of what you want.  Finally, I really like the idea (more on this to follow) of the included single-ear earpiece.\n\nBut...\n\nAs noted, this thing is loud, which is great, except when you don't need it to be super loud.  No problem, I think, until I realize the unit has no volume control.  Really?  Oh, that's what the earpiece must be for, right?  Well... here's where one solid star is lost.  There is zero, and I mean zero, reduction in decibel level between the main speaker and the earpiece.  I'm confident had I left it in my ear for more than a few beats, serious damage would be done to my hearing.  And I know that last sentence sounds like hyperbolic crap.  Well... you've been warned.  Needless to say, I find the earpiece completely useless, as opposed to being the really nice feature it should be.\n\nMy other complaint, although a minor one, is the quality of the enclosure.  I wish they had opted for a plastic I felt would survive a 4' drop onto a hard floor.  With a battery, this thing weighs in at 170g (6oz), and I'm sure it's going to get knocked off the music stand eventually.

I garden, and between some tea roses that grow like weeds, and keeping my Bonsai collection in shape, I tend to use shears at least every week. The blades on these are composed of high carbon steel (very strong steel, that stays sharp.) High carbon steel will resist rust better than regular steel, but you might still want to oil your cutting surface from time to time, to prevent surface rust. They have a nice grip, and are easy to cut with. The spring mechanism works well too. Other inexpensive shears I've used in the yard, tend to break in two ways. First, the spring will weaken and break, and/or the bolt that holds the shear blades together, will snap on you. That won't happen the first year you own them, rarely the second year, but eventually, those shears will get a busted spring or bolt. What impresses me with these shears, is that the manufacturer has included a second bolt, and a second spring. So when you buy these, you are buying a garden tool which will last you a lifetime. Just keep the spring and bolt in a small plastic bag marked GARDEN SHEARS in your tool box. If, in five years or ten years time, the shears break on you, its only a minute job to fix them.  Personally, I'd rather pay a couple extra dollars, and get a quality tool that lasts for a couple of decades, than buy something cheap that needs to be replace every other year.

What sets this pruner apart from others like it in my opinion is the addition of an extra spring and bolt screw that holds the whole thing together.

The springs on these kind of things give out and rust, break, long before anything else gives on it, and they have already provided you with a new one when ready.  (As long as you don't lose it over time which is what usually happens to me).  The addition of a connector bolt is also a nice idea if you have to take it apart for any reason and either lose it or feel that its time to be replaced.  A nice touch for the price.

Ive had other mats like this and they are definitely not for high traffic areas because they crush down and the image wears out. I would never use this outdoors because it wouldnt last. As one reviewer is doing, using it as wall art, it is perfect. It really is that pretty and the peacock stands out nicely.

When I purchased this it was a compromise. I normally will not use pre-muffled heads, but could not get an Ambassador weight unmuffled head at the time because they were back ordered.\n\nI opted for a Diplomat weight to offset the muffling, which is nothing more than a plastic ring on the backside of the head. To further offset the muffling, I opted to not use my tried and true approach:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gibraltar-SC-BF-Bass-Drum-Felt-Strips-2-Pack/dp/B0002F783A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gibraltar SC-BF Bass Drum Felt Strips 2/Pack</a>.

Frankly it exceeded my expectations and when I was able to obtain the Ambassador weight, unmuffled heads I wanted in the first place they did not come close to matching the warmth and depth this head and the companion reso provide. Sometimes one does get lucky.\n\nMy concern that the Diplomat weight would not hold under live playing was assuaged by the fact that I actually used this kit as backline in a jam and the head held up fine. So much for stories of coating loss and short lifespan.\n\nNeedless to say, the serendipitous events that led me to purchasing this head against my better judgement (at the time) worked in my favor.

I like having my ride cymbal at a further distance than what the stock hardware was allowing. So I needed an extended boom to suite mu needs. I ordered this boom arm with that in mind. The hardware is about what you would expect from Gibraltar with a nice solid feel and heft to it. Definitely more solid than the stock hardware you get with the electronic kits. So the hardware quality is top notch, but there are two limitations:\n\n- The size of the Gibraltar boom stand is slightly larger than what the drum rack can accept. So I just took the boom arm off and added it to the electronic set's arm stand. With some loosening it fits perfectly fine. So I have a stand base that I can't use, but that's a small price to pay. For any of you looking to modify your set like me look for the Gibraltar Boom Arm for Drum Racks. It may be a better fit.\n\n- The length of the boom arm isn't quite as long as I wanted. Now this one is on me.

There are ways to fudge the limited angles of adjustment but you're working out at the extreme of the arms adjustments and it's not worth risking a $300 cymbal playing games.

In my opinion, the best settings are for the AC15 and AC30, but the amp sounds great on all of the amp models you provided.  I think it's very versatile and perfect for an intermediate guitarist.  I don't think I'd use it for typical gigging, but it's loud enough for a backyard gig or a smaller venue.\n\nThe sound is much warmer than a straight solid state amp, while being substantially cheaper than a full tube amp. I purchased the Vox AC4TV to replace this amp, which sounded great, but I could hear the tube rattle if I set the volume louder than 4.  I exchanged the first AC4TV I bought for this reason, and I returned the second one.  The AD15VT has been reliable and sounded decent since day 1.\n\nThe on-board effects are the only downside.  The delay and reverb are passable, but setting them is a vague pursuit.  I occasionally use the compressor setting, which seems fine, but you can't use it with any other effects.  I find the chorus, phaser, and flanger marginal.

Also, I'm not sure about ultra high gain amp models, as I seldom use much distortion and haven't monkeyed around with those settings too much.\n\nI have played through many of the genuine amps that this amp claims to mimic, and I must say, it does a fairly decent job of recreating them (within reason). Obviously, if your looking for a top of the line, holy grail, solve-all-of-my-problems-kind of amp or if you are a more seasoned player who is looking for that one signature sound and kind of already know what you want, skip this one and get yourself the real deal( a genuine Twin, Bassman, AC30, etc....)Modeling amps probably aren't for you. But for the price, this amp is just the ticket for late night practice/rehersal/recording sessions. This amp will not only serve as a solid choice for practice and/or jamming, it may help guide the player to what kind of amp they may want as their primary amp in the future.\n\n(I had posted this review on another website [retailer shall remain nameless])", "reviewerID": "A12N0TST8MLHMF", "reviewerName": "M.

{"asin": "B0002F5JFO", "overall": "5.0", "reviewText": "This combo drumstick and timpani mallet is one more tool for a general percussionist, but works nicely for we drum kit players as well. I use the mallet end for playing cymbal crescendos and diminuendos, as well as some patterns on toms and snare drums with the snares disengaged.\n\nThere are some things that I personally do not care for, but those reflect preference and should not be construed to be flaws. The first thing that I do not like is the diameter, which at .625 inches feels gigantic compared to my normal sticks which are in the .500 to .515 inch range. If you like heavier and thicker sticks you will love these. The taper on the stick end is short and abrupt, so if you play traditional grip like myself the feel of the stick takes some getting use to. For French and German grip players the feel is near perfect.\n\nThe stick end has a ball tip that allows you to achieve maximum cymbal articulation. I would have preferred a teardrop form, but the ball end has interesting possibilities in my own sound palette because my cymbals typically have a rich set of over and undertones. I do not get the rebound I can with a teardrop tip off my drums, but the trade-off for more articulate notes is worth it in my opinion.\n\nI love the mallet end, which is tight and attenuates the sound of open tuned toms. I also like the rebound of that end. And I especially like the 16 11/16ths length, which is perfect for me because it gives me access to any spot on the 24\" rides I frequently play.

If, like me, you are doing one nighters, and if you wish to disassemble your rack and transport it in a common carrying case ( I use a Road Runner 50\" case - which you need for the long mounting rack segment) then you HAVE to perform this cumbersome screwing process every time you break and set (the \"T\" of the vertical and floor leg will not fit in the case - it is not nearly wide enough).

I started to research and found that grill mat can work for me. so many grill mats, go figure which one to choose..  So I got this great promotion to get this Wonder mats in exchange to my honest review and I can't thank enough!!! the thickness is just right ( and let me tell you something, the best thickness for grill mat is 2 mm anything thicker than that is just unnecessary), the heat resistant is perfect (YES, I've learned that anyone who advertised heat resistant over 500F is just a Gimmick since the FDA allows PTFE coated cooking accessories to be used only below 500F).\n The best part are the sizes of the mats. one XL mat really makes the different- when you want to grill many food items at the same time.\nWhen it comes to cleaning up I no longer have to feel guilty about throwing away the foil and adding to the land fills. I would recommend these to my friends and family. Not only that it makes your food much healthier but it is also earth friendly and gives back to our community.\nHighly recommended !

I've already tried Burgers, eggs  grilled cheese and more Nothing  sticks!!\n-Cleans up easily. some soap and water and that's it.\nThe best part: I no longer have to get the grill brush and scrape the grates.

Even though they make tools to clean your grill quickly and efficiently,  (yes, I do have them), I hate doing it!  So, the Wonder Grill Mat Set Of 3 BBQ Mats seemed like a perfect solution.  When I grill, I use almost the entire cooking surface of our gas grill to feed my husband and sons.  There is one XL grilling mat, 16x20 in, and two smaller mats, 13x16 in.  They are nonstick, teflon-coated--so no need for oil or coating the mats.  You just put meat, fish, kabobs, sausage, etc on the mat and then watch them cook to perfection.  Even with cooking on the mats, meats still had grill marks, which surprised me.  I did have a problem, though, when I was grilling homemade hamburgers.  The grease from the mat built up on the mat, and my husband pushed it to the edges of the mat.  I'm. Guessing the heat was high, and the match did catch fire.  After we got the flames controlled, I cut small slits in the mat so the grease would drip down rather than stay on the mat.  This solved the problem.  All in all, I love using them to barbecue.  I don't have to worry about cleanup of the grates. Now I just  wipe the mat clean and roll it up until the next  use.  When we go to the park and want to throw hot dogs on the grill while the grandkids play on the equipment, we don't have to worry about dirty grills.  We bring along our grill mats.  So convenient!  I love them!  No more worrying if I have aluminum foil on hand when I want to bbq.  We keep these mats right by the grill so it's right there when we need them.  They are Lifetime Guaranteed!

And for trombonists the slide is a very important part of the instrument and one which is personal to each individual.  Every player needs to try out different types of oils/creams to determine which is best for them.\n\nFor my part, I have found that the Yamaha brand slide cream has consistently made my trombone slides very smooth and very quiet.  I have used several makes over the years, but primarily King, Conn and Bach.  This works amazingly well with everything.  And very little of the cream is actually required to achieve an effective result.  Also, I have found the product lasts much longer than other oils and creams.\n\nAs a player of nearly twenty years, I highly recommend to any trombonists to give this product a try and see if it works for you as well as it has for myself.", "reviewerID": "A3AK8LAZW2TQST", "reviewerName": "Michael Gan", "summary": "The best trombone slide cream, in my humble opinion.", "verified": "true", "vote": "4", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140009407}

First, it arrived from Musician's Friend in excellent condition with no damage and no real manufacturing suprises except a slightly irregular staining of the lower fretboard. It's pretty minor and I can live with it. Otherwise its about as close to a pristine guitar as possible. It is a slightly short guitar compaired to other dreadnoughts I know (by about an inch.) The Mahogany is deep, rich and red. The finish is very shiny, which is not exactly to my taste, I would have been happier with a non-glossy finish, but some may like it (Rogue take note!).  The voice of the guitar is bright and crisp, which you would expect of a guitar that is a virtual infant and has not yet had time to open up. The strings were okay, neither high nor low end. It does have its own unique voice however and I played a number of bluegrass tunes on it and was quite satisfied.

Well, I don't know if mine were part of a defective batch or something because I had an issue with melting that I didn't see in any of the other reviews I read before purchasing.\n\nThe extra large mat worked well and withstood the heat with a only a few minor areas of melting. I used it to make some grilled chicken thighs and noticed upon washing the mat that there were a few rough parts in the corners that weren't there when I washed it before use. I figured a little bit of melting was expected since these are used over very high heat. However, I just used the two smaller mats to grill some hot dogs and was very disappointed with the condition of the mats afterward. Both mats now have permanent grill mark indentations all over them (something that didn't happen to the extra large one). These marks are all cracked and peeling (see included pics), and I am now afraid to use them again. The hot dogs cooked fine, they weren't burnt so anything so the temperature of the grill wasn't too high.\n\nI am very disappointed in the results after only one use, as I had hoped these would last at least through the summer.

This guitar stays in tune, is very loud, projects well, and plays extremely well for an acoustic guitar in the price range.  I have never had issues with construction, humidity, bridge or nut. Everything except the bridge pins are original.  I own more expensive acoustics that do not possess the powerful projection this guitar has. Like I said, it's loud, articulate, and it rings beautifully. In Ten years, I have done a 1/8 of a turn on the truss rod to set my neck to my liking.  There are no buzzes, noises etc. from the guitar except what I demand of it.  Interior construction shows good if plain bracing, very good brace sanding and no wood feathers anywhere.  I guess my only knock is the headstock which is a tiny bit out of scale to the body, it's too long, but thats a minor personal observation.\n\nToo bad they stopped making them, they are a great guitar for even the money they were charging for them when discontinued, which I think was about 50 bucks more.  It's got 5 ply binding on the front, black binding on neck, and back, and is well constructed throughout.  As the guitar has aged, I have watched it darken, and the top is a bit wavy now, but I have played the heck out of this guitar and it's a real trooper, so I expect some movement after all these years.

I pulled it past the last (third) opening the first time and the leg extension came right off, and was a tad bit of a pain to put back on. It's minor, but just need to remember the 3rd opening is the last. I guess it'd be good to flush out sand crammed in the leg if needed?

You've probably seen a lot of reviews in which people sing the unconditional praises of the TI jazz flats, and an alarming number of reviews in which people describe the strings as having the tension of \"loose rubber bands\".  Even the people who like the strings claim that they require a gentle touch because of the low tension of these strings.\n\nThis may be a true perception for those who are used to a higher tension flatwound.  However, by raising my action at the saddles, I was easily able to provide a level of tension and playability comparable to the roundwounds GHS I previously had on my Ibanez SR-375, and avoid fret-buzz all the way down the neck.  The B string is fairly monstrous on these (.136), and may require that you have your nut filed for it to fit correctly.  I did this myself (probably ill-advised), but if I'd had a spare $50 lying around, I would not have hesitated to bring my instrument in for a proper setup.\n\nWhether you do it yourself, or bring it to an expert, you are almost certainly going to need a full setup when installing these strings.\n\nI moved to flats because I'm looking for a less metallic, woodier, and more centered fundamental tone with less string noise.  These strings help me to accomplish all of this.  If you're looking for a snappy slap and pop funk sound, this probably isn't going to be your string.\n\nIs it worth it to lay down the cheddar for fancy strings from Austria?  I cannot answer that question for you.\n\nAll I can say for certain, is that had I not, there would still be a lingering question in my mind as to whether or not I had the right strings on my bass.

{"asin": "B015W1V5DC", "overall": "5.0", "reviewText": "To start out, I will say that I have owned E-Z Up brand canopies for years.  This is my 4th or 5th.  I've always like them for the strength, easy setup and that they last a long time.  I'm in Colorado where we get crazy weather.  We could get hit with high gusty winds, rain, hail or people playing Pokemon Go who aren't watching where they are going.  They have always stood the test in the weather, but I always had one regret...  They are heavy!  E_Z Up makes tanks and they feel like them....  This one is everything I wish my past canopies could have been.\n\nI am comparing this to my other canopy by E-Z Up that is from their commercial line.  Both have the same 10x10 size.  This Dome Shelter is about half the weight of what I am used to and much easier to setup.  The weight reduction comes from the poles the support the arch of the canopy.  Those are made from what looks like a nice fiberglass pole.  There is plenty of support and the vent in the roof keeps the canopy from catching too much wind and putting pressure on those poles.  That being said, I have seen some decent winds with this canopy and it stood up to them pretty well.  The winds were enough to blow other canopies that weren't anchored into the air and over.  The poles supporting the arch barely moved.\n\nThe other great thing about this canopy is te bag!  The wheels are great! The problem with the other wheeled bags I'm used to is they get this \"teeter\" effect when you get walking too fast.  I think it happens because the wheelbase is narrow relative to the size of the case and the weight sits directly over or extends beyond the wheels.  This case has a wide wheel base and big rollerblade-style wheels.  On a Saturday morning at 6AM when I am trying to get this setup next to the pool for my sons swim meet, I can move faster than the other dads out there and get a better spot!\n\nI already put the commercial canopy up on CL and this is now my go to for keeping family and friends in the shade!", "reviewerID": "A1C266FQ0QEC6P", "reviewerName": "ElWicki", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" 10 by 10'\",\"Color:\":\" Royal Blue\"}", "summary": "Why haven't they made them like this forever?!", "verified": "true", "vote": "21", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140009798}

My buddy wound up bringing his out there so I decided I need to get one and started the search.  I typically wouldn't buy something with so few reviews but I decided to bite the bullet with this one... and I'm glad I did.\n\nWhile being a little more expensive than others I saw, I believe it was worth every penny I paid for it.\n\nInitially, the box comes with the frame, cover, storage bag, and wheels/axle (for the storage bag) all separate. Putting the wheels on the storage bag took all of 3 minutes by myself in the dark outside.  Installing the cover to the frame for its first use was more of a task but it was very intuitive (directions are also on the side of the storage bag for those that don't understand) and can be done easily with 3 people.  Once the cover is installed, it stays attached to the frame and folds with it for storage.\nThe storage bag is extremely useful.  It feels very well built.  Has directions sewn on the side, pockets for the stakes, and heavy duty wheels.  It easily slips over the fully folded up frame and zips up until you want to use it again.\n\nI strongly recommend this product.\n\nOnly real gripe I have are the available colors.

I must say, I love my EZ up. We have already used it multiple times for my daughters' soccer games and it has held up without any problems.  The tent is heavy, but the most difficult thing is that it is long when it is stored in the bag. I have a 2016 pilot and I have to push the middle row up as far as possible and angle the case diagonally to make it fit. So, if you have a regular sedan, I would not recommend this EZ up, due to the size.\nAs for the quality, this thing is fantastic. It is very easy to set up with 2 people, and I have been able to put up and take down by myself as well; it just takes a little extra time and patience. All of the parts glide smoothly and lock into place and unlock out of place with ease. I have helped others on our team put up their cheaper quality tents and it is not an easy task due to the poor quality of materials used in constructing the frame, especially the hardware for the telescoping legs. The cheaper tents are lighter, so are easier to transport, however they are definitely not as durable as this EZ Up Pyramid. You get what you pay for and in the long run, I absolutely believe that the cost of ownership of the EZ up will be much cheaper than the brands you can buy for cheap at your big box stores.\nI also love that you can go to the EZ up website and buy replacement parts for your  frame or canopy should they break.  The trusses and other frame parts, that are more prone to failure, are only $10/part. So, if you are so unlucky to have a failure in your frame, you can just replace the part, as opposed to buying another cheap canopy because the cheap canopy company doesn't provide replacement parts for their products.\nThe canopy appears very durable as well and shows no signs of wear, even at the corners, with regular use.\n\nI would highly recommend this product, as long as you have a car big enough to transport this canopy.", "reviewerID": "A208TUHDVP7T51", "reviewerName": "Teddy kgb", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" 10 by 10'\",\"Color:\":\" Splash\"}", "summary": "GREAT CANOPY!", "verified": "false", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140009938}

{"asin": "B015W1VJEW", "overall": "1.0", "reviewText": "---update after several uses---\n\nI've recently realized that my review below did not include a reference to the EZ-UP Small Hammer accessory.  This was not provided in my initial order either, but is apparently necessary for liberating one of the four legs enough to raise and lower it like the others.  Mind you, I've only used it for one week at the beach and a handful of other times, I keep the tent in its bag which is stored in the garage, and I've rinsed it down 2 or 3 times to cleanse it from salt and sand.\n\nSpeaking of sand, don't those 'heavy duty wheels' on the bag look appealing?  They are indeed the masters of lawns and sidewalks, but as for the beach - if yours is not hard-packed sand (the kind you can ride bicycles on) then you'll be in for yet another challenge. I've named my bag The Dune Maker...\n\nReviewers who state that this product is easy to erect by 1 person are not telling you that a) they are torquing the heck out of the frame, or b) they're making more laps around it than a Nascar driver on Sundays.\n\n****original review follows****\n\nThe frame is a little on the heavy side when compared to other 10x10s.  I'll assume that equates to sturdiness. It is best anchored with weight bags, as it does not have guylines.  The bag is sturdy as well, though the zipper goes around the bag (vs length-wise) about 10\" from one end; the easiest method of packing it back up seems to be to involve 2 people.  The shorter person slides the bag over the still standing (but collapsed) frame while the taller one holds the rest of the bag high enough to allow it to slide over the frame easily.  It's kind of comical, really.  Once on fully - down to the zipper - flip the canopy so that it is doing a headstand, feet up.  Pull the bag upwards and mightily, flip the bottom 10\" section over the frame's feet, and zip away.  Voila!\nMost frustrating, however, is that after about 6 uses in light winds ( <=10mph), I noticed scrape marks on the inside of each the sidewalls of the canopy, right where the articulating frame rubs against the canopy fabric and midway between the legs.  There are 4 such scrapes, which are not yet full tears, but they have me quite concerned.  Alas, I did not receive any EZ-UP Waterproof Duct Tape, protective EZ-UP Adhesive Nylon Patches, or EZ-UP Fuzzy Tennis Balls to slice and cover the offending frame joints within the original packaging.\nWait a second....that wasn't actually the most frustrating part.  I did my typical and ridiculous amount of research in order to replace and upgrade from a Coleman canopy tent which was cheaper and lasted 4 years of beach trips and refugee camps marketed as outdoor swim meets.  I had such high hopes for this, given the 4-point-whatever stars other users have given it....\nA \"by the way\", if you've lasted this long: If you don't have a mini-van or pickup truck, please note that the sturdy bag wheels are not rated for highway speeds; do not tow this thing behind your car.  Find a strong, preferably bearded man to lift this onto your roof rack instead; it might not fit in  many SUVs without getting really creative.", "reviewerID": "A1I7LTPCQ08C0U", "reviewerName": "ADJuto", "style": "{\"Size:\":\" 10 by 10'\",\"Color:\":\" Splash\"}", "summary": "***updated review**Weird bag closure, the fabric is being ripped by the frame's joints, and it's a little heavy.", "verified": "true", "vote": "2", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140009964}

My experience with percussion is limited to a year of middle school band practice with a beginner's bell kit back in 2000, and the occasional bang on a friend's full set as I grew older, however, I seem to recall even more \"rustic\" or \"novelty\" sets I've crossed paths with providing a sound and feel that I personally found more appealing in comparison to this set, which is actually advertised as a serious musical instrument. I feel as though the skin on this set is stretched so tightly that there is no actual \"percussion,\" which causes a very flat tone comparable to banging on any other accessible solid surface. One of the metal bands around the bottom of the set was somewhat loose when I first started using this set, and I attempted to tighten it several times,  however, it was noticeably distorted and several attempts to repair it only resulted in the band eventually falling off entirely. The piece that connects the two bongos, additionally, is made of plastic and not wood, as it might appear to other prospective buyers. None of these factors were reason enough for me not to dust these off once in a while and still bang out a beat on them for fun, but if you are looking for something with the \"classic bongo sound\" that is often heard in songs and movies, I would suggest spending a little bit more money than I did.", "reviewerID": "A14L9AN8BW63JY", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "summary": "A fun toy to pass around at parties, but not for the serious musician", "verified": "true", "internal_partition": "0", "partition_number": 140009979}

{"asin": "B0002F5JF4", "overall": "4.0", "reviewText": "I'm not a musician, but I work for a drum company-So I actually have been trained in what makes a good drum. I decided I wanted to learn the bongos because they looked fun, but I did not know if I would take them up seriously-So I wanted a pair of bongos that were well-made and had a good sound, but not so expensive that I would feel guilty if I decided I did not want to play bongos after all.\n\nThese fit the bill exactly. They have 4 all metal tuning lugs, the hoop is metal and the head is skin-I think buffalo. The rest of the hardware is metal where it needs to be metal with one exception listed below. The body is natural wood with a nice color.\n\nThere are some negatives. For one, the block that connects the two drums together is plastic. It's solid and not hollow, but I think you may have to be careful if you ever used this with a metal bongo stand-as the plastic could crack. Putting two pieces of wood between the plastic and the stand may help that-but it is a negative. The second problem is that there is a band on the bottom that holds the body together. It is essentially the same sort of band that is used to secure radiator hoses on engines. It could be overtightened and looks cheap. I had to tighten it up a little.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the heads, the skin is kind of rough to the touch. A pair of Remo heads would really be better, but the truth is they would cost you more than these bongos are worth to replace.\n\nAs far as the sound goes, I really like it. You can make a lot of sound from this drum fairly easy. The tuning lugs make a real difference in adjusting the sound. It is fun to play.\n\nIf you do buy these, You may want to do what one my drum technicians told me to do when I got this home.\n\n1. Take the heads off.(unscrew the lugs all the way, lift off the hoop and the head)\n2. Sand the lip where the head sits. (it was not sanded and was rough, almost splintery)\n3. Using parafin, seal the lip\n\nThis will make the head last longer, and makes a better seal between the head and drum. I think it made the drum sound better too.\n\nAnother good idea is don't leave the drum tuned if you are not using it for a while. This will lengthen the life of the head, especially if you are somewhere where the weather can get really cold, as a skin drum head can split in the cold.\n\n11/27/08-Update to this review.\nI have played these drums for almost a whole year now. I joined a group where I was playing the drums several times a week. The metal hoop on the larger drum became bent even though I never left it tuned when I wasn't playing it. More expensive bongos have much heavier duty hardware that does not lose its shape so easily. I found out that replacing the part would cost almost as much as the bongos. Since I actually play bongos on a regular basis in front of people now, I invested in a pair of Latin Percussion Aspire bongos that have a great sound and much heavier duty hardware.\n\nI still reccomend the Pulse B-2 Bongos if you think you want to play bongos, but don't know for sure and don't want to spend a lot of money, just don't expect them to last forever.

E-Z Up has a well-earned reputation for producing a rugged canopy and the Vantage does not disappoint.  The hardware on the legs and closing mechanisms are much improved over the express, giving LARGE buttons for leg operation and HUGE plastic pull rings to collapse the top.  The roller bag, itself, was worth the upgrade price as it now includes larger wheels with a big wheelbase and comfort grips on the pull handles.  Also, unlike the express, the Vantage has more room in the carry bag so the bag stitches are not under stress just from loading the canopy inside.\n\nWe LOVE the color as it's easy to spot us on the beach.

Once underneath, you can then push up on the center of the framework and it will expand enough to drape over the fabric and complete the setup.\n\nAnother big plus is the carry bag. The wheels are substantial and wide set so it's easier to move across turf or gravel.
