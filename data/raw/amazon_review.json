    "reviewText":"Crazy Taxi is by far one of the best video games I've ever played. The sountrack, gameplay, and replay value are insane! There are only 2 levels, but it is still fun to play over and over and over again! Basically, the objective is to drive around and take customers to the place they want to go. Boring, right? Wrong! Drive as crazy as you like, from crashing into cars to jumping over stuff, or just driving all around crazy! If you don't make it to the customer's destination in time, they'll jump out of the car, which is pretty funny. There are four drivers, and they all have one heck of an attitude. My personal fav is Gus. He's old, but he always plays it cool. Many people think S is the best license you can get, but after that it's awesome and after that it's crazy. There are three modes, arcade, original, and crazy box. Arcade and original are basically the same, except the course on which you play. Crazy Box is a series of minigames. Overall, This Game rules! Unless you've already bought it, buy it now while you can. Despite all the bad reviews For this game, it rocks and you should buy it. Nintendo rules!",
